# Build Anything Quick

Use outline and recursive decomposition instead of traditional loading bar style. Don't try to make the outline perfect at first. [^1]

## Outline Speed-running for Programming

1. Decide the main purpose
1. Break the program into parts by feature
1. For each part, repeat steps 1 and 2 until it is small
1. Implement from bottom up
