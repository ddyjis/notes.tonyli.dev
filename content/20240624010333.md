# NFT Market Has High Market risk

This was my note from [gooaye podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/gooaye-%E8%82%A1%E7%99%8C/id1500839292?i=1000548656831) written in 2022-09

> NFTs are non-fungible. 99% of them are **really** pointless, valueless ownership to digital images. These NFTs are exposed to large market risk. If one day people lost faith in investing NFT market (not NFT itself), no one would like to buy any of these because they are non-fungible and non-liquid in nature.

This was accurate and most NFTs have their values dropped to 0. Note that this doesn't imply every NFT collection has no value.
