This is my digital notebook. It works like the Pensieve in the Harry Potter Series - I organize my mind by storing my thoughts and ideas in it. It is designed with a focus on simple workflow and maximized output. Notes are connected though bi-directional links, creating a network of ideas that mirrors the complexity of human brain.

Although these notes are public, the target audience is actually myself. This means I have the freedom to be creative and authentic to myself. This freedom also allows me to capture ideas fast which streamlines the process of note-taking.
