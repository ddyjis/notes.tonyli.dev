# Avoid Collector's Fallacy

Knowledge is not gained through collection. Collection gives an illusion about "learning" something. It is like photo-copying when I was in school - the only feedback I got was a pile of paper. Photo-copying doesn't give you knowledge. You have to digest and take notes.
