# Review on Masterworks

Masterworks provides alternative investments. It allows individuals to invest in a small portion of artworks. It is like [[20240624011027|NFT]] backed by actual art artifacts. Minimum investment is $1000.

## Pros

- A mean of alternative investment, especially in high inflation periods
- With experts to look for and take care of the artworks
- Liquidity through secondary market
- Make fine-art investment accessible to regular investors

## Cons

- High management fee - 1.5% annual fee + 20% profit (for the services from their art experts and legal)
- Auction commission (13%) before buying the product
- High risk investment
- Long time needed to realize the profit and no recurring income in between
- Can only sell the fractional share early in the secondary market
- Profits are not considered capital gain so they are subject to higher tax rates
- Secondary market only available to US citizen

## Conclusion

If the portion of the artwork you pick has less than 20% annualized return, the final return would be less than Index Fund ETF. Art experts would try their best to look for good investment but no one can guarantee.
