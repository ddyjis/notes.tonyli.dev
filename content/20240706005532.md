## High Interest Savings Account ETFs

Corporations use investor's money to deposit in banks' savings accounts. The large volume of money allows corporations to bargain for higher interest rates.

Advantage: Small amount of MER; A mean of high interest deposit with tax benefits if deposited in registered accounts.

Disadvantage: Not considered as deposit so not covered by CDIC; A bit lower liquidity because the trading is limited to market hours.

## Treasury Bill ETFs

Short term government bond. It is backed by the government so it is considered protected.

Examples: `CBIL-T`, `UBIL.U-T`
