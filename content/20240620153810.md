# Registered Retirement Savings Plans

Contribution limit each year is

$$
\text{Contribution}=min(0.18I_{t-1},L_t)
$$

Where $I_t$ is the personal income in year $t$; $L_t$ is the upper limit in contribution in year $t$

Contribution can be used to deduct taxable income. **Unused contribution** can be carried forward. **Excess contribution** (exceed by $2000) will have penalty - 1% per month.

When withdraw after retire, the amount is considered the income of that year.

At age 71, you have to withdraw all the amount or transfer them to RRIF #TODO or convert to annuity.

## Contribution Limit History

- $L_{2025}=32490$
- $L_{2024}=31560$
- $L_{2023}=30780$
- $L_{2022}=29210$
- $L_{2021}=27830$
- $L_{2020}=27230$
- $L_{2019}=26500$
- $L_{2018}=26230$

This somehow tells what the federal government "thinks an individual is earning too much" at income $\tilde{I_t}$.

- $\tilde{I}_{2024}=180500$
- $\tilde{I}_{2023}=175333$
- $\tilde{I}_{2022}=171000$
- $\tilde{I}_{2021}=162278$
- $\tilde{I}_{2020}=154611$
- $\tilde{I}_{2019}=151277$
- $\tilde{I}_{2018}=147222$
- $\tilde{I}_{2017}=145722$

Not sure how the upper limit is determined. According to Statistics Canada,[^2] in 2021 the 95th percentile is earning $139000 which I guess the limit comes from around top 3%.

## Converting MPF to RRSP

There is something called section 6L that allows you to deposit overseas retirement plan to RRSP (one time).[^1] There is a time limit that you have to deposit the amount once withdraw.
