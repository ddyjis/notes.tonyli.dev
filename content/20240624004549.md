# CAD-Hedged Securities

Currency risk is offset by hedging strategies e.g. futures, options.

If CAD 📈 goes up against USD, loss of value in the USD assets in terms of CAD will be offset by the hedging.

✅ This makes the hedged security stable in value and more predictable.

❎ Hedging implies costs. You also have limited earning if the foreign currency goes up and not coming back.

On the other side, unhedged securities can be considered more diversified.
