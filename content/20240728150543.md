# Layers of Car Paints

5 layers

- Wax / Coating Layer / PPF
- Clear Coat
- Base Coat / Color Coat
- Primer
- Metal

## Wax / Coating Layer / PPF

- Acts as a sacrificial layer
- Protects against air / UV / water
- Thin layer

## Clear Coat

- No color
- Protects against UV
- Protects the inner layer
- Makes the car looks shiny

## Base Coat / Color Coat

- Raw paint so no hardener or strengthener
- No protection

## Primer

- Make the surface ready for painting
- Without it, the color paint won't stick consistently

## Metal
