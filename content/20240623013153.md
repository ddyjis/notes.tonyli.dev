## Commission

A few dollars for each FX conversion.

Very low commission rate on stocks. I once argued with someone on Thread. He claimed to use a complicated procedure to "minimize fees and costs" (Salary in CAD from bank --> transfer to IB and convert to USD --> use IB monthly free withdraw to move USD to Questrade --> buy USD ETF in Questrade with 0 fee). I would say - you are so smart. Keep going. May be I am wrong. He is earning so much and buy so many ETF that IB would charge a fee.

## FX Rates

Best FX rate. Lowest spread.

Also good interest rate. Note that they advertise to have a certain rate with cash balance but there is a catch. The first 10000 USD or equivalent do not entitle to interest. For a certain currency, the actual interest rate $i'$ is

$$
i'=\frac{(C-10000S)\times i}{C}
$$

Where

- $i$ is the advertised interest
- $C$ is the cash
- $S$ is the `USD/FX` rate

For example, we have

- 1 USD = 1.3 CAD
- 13000 CAD cash
- advertised interest rate is 5%

Which translates to

$$
\begin{cases}
  i=0.05 \\
  C=13000 \\
  S=1.3
\end{cases}
$$

We get $i'=0$.

For $C=20000$, $i'=0.0175$; For $C=100000$, $i'=0.0435$
