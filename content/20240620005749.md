# Write with My Own Words Rule

Use my own words, even though it is just paraphrasing. Learning only happens when I use efforts to produce output. Write something, instead of copy-pasting.

LLMs are common nowadays. It is acceptable to use them summarizing information. But I still need to write.

A hack for me is to use my bilingual mind - translate to English or do a round trip. Cantonese and English are very different languages. Translating can force my brain to work.

Exception are factual notes e.g. snippets.
