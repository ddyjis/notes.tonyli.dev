# B-tree

- What kind of data structure B-tree is?
	- Self-balancing tree data structure
- Are the data sorted?
	- Yes
- Complexity?
	- Search $O(\log n)$
	- Sequential access $O(\log n)$
	- Insertion $O(\log n)$
	- Deletion $O(\log n)$
- How is it different from binary tree?
	- Generalized binary tree. Each node can have more than 2 children.
- Where is it used?
	- For storage. Used in database and file systems.

## Definition

A B-tree of order $K$ has the following properties

- Each node stores $N$ values, where $1 < N \le K$
- Each internal node (non-leaf and non-node) has at least $\frac{N}{2}$ values
- Each node has $N+1$ children
- Root node has at least 1 value and 2 children (unless it is the sole node)
- All leaves are on the same level

### Node

Within a node,  

- $K$: maximum number of potential search keys in each node. It is a constant for the whole tree.
- $pt_i$: pointer to the child node
- $pr_i$: pointer to the record
- $k_i$: search key

## Searching

## Inserting

## Deleting
