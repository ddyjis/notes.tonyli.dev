# Taylor Series

The approximation of a function at a point with infinite sum of terms expressed in the function's derivatives at that point. [^1]

#TODO: any requirements for the function?

$$
f(x)=f(a)+\frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2+\frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3+...=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

This gives the approximation of the value $f(x)$ at the point $a$.

With $a=0$, we get the Maclaurin series

$$
f(x)=f(0)+\frac{f'(0)}{1!}x+\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2+\frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3+...=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n
$$

The general form (Taylor series) would give a better approximation if the function has significant change near point $a$. Choosing $a$ at specific point of interest would affect the rate of convergence of the approximation.

**First-order approximation centered at 0**

$$
f(x)\approx f(0)+xf'(0)
$$

**Second-order approximation centered at 0**

$$
f(x)\approx f(0)+xf'(0)+\frac{x^2}{2}f''(0)
$$
