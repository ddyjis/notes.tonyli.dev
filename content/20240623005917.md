# NFT Communities Are Clubhouses

NFT was really hot in 2021. It's intend was good but people found ways to abuse it and create scams. At the end, each community developed into some sort of clubhouse. You need to pay for a token to join one, granting you access to their party. Similar to cryptocurrencies, only the largest ones have values to invest. So in terms of investment, the entrance fee is very high. So high that it does not worth joining.

## Reincarnation of NFT Scams

In 2024, people found another way to present a similar NFT scam concept - the Banana game on Steam. There are many games of similar nature on Steam but Banana ended up the most popular one. It had a record of 800k people online at the same time. This number is comparable to CS2.

The game is like cookie clicker but you click a banana. Every some hours you will get special bananas which have different rarity. You can sell those bananas. Depending on how rare the banana is, some resell price went up to 1000 USD. For common ones they still have around 0.03 USD value so people "think" they can earn money by spending time on it.
