# The Rule of 72

Compound interest is calculated as

$$
V=P\times (1+r)^n
$$

It is common to know how long would it take for the initial amount to become doubled.

$$
2=(1+r)^n \Rightarrow \ln(2)=n\ln(1+r)
$$

The approximation for $n$ is $\frac{72}{R}$ where $R=100r$.

Using first-order [[20240912132856|Taylor Series approximation]] centred at $0$ for $f(r)=\ln(1+r)$,[^1]

$$
\ln(1+r)\approx\ln(1)+\frac{f'(0)}{1!}r=0+\frac{\frac{1}{1+0}}{1!}r=r
$$

$$
n\approx \frac{\ln(2)}{r}=\frac{.693}{r}
$$

We use $72$ because it is divisible by many numbers.

For rates closer to $0$, we can use the rule of 69.3 but that requires some calculation. For rates smaller than 0.05, we can use the rule of 70. For rates less than 0.1, we can use the rule of 72.
