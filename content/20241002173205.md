# React Tips

## Let React Context Fail Loud

When creating a context, use `null` instead of an object with empty values that matches the shape of the context. In the hook that consumes the context, throw an error if the context is null. This allows the context to fail loudly when set up is incorrect. [^1]

```tsx
type BookContextType = {
  book: { name: string };
  changeName: (_: name) => void;
}

// null! here for type assertion
const BookContext = createContext<BookContextType>(null!)

// hook
const useBook = () => {
  const value = useContext(BookContext)

  if (!value) throw new Error('useBook hook used without BookContext!')
  
  return value
}

// component
const BookForm = () => {
  const { book, changeName } = useBook()

	return (
	  <BookContext.Provider value={{ ... }}>
	    <h1>Book: {book.name}</h1>
	    <input value={book.name} onChange={(e) => changeName(e.target.value)} />
	  </div>
	)
}
```

## Re-rendering

### Something that Does NOT Depend on the Context Changes when the Context Changes [^1]

This is because that "something" is a child **inside** a parent component, and the context is the dependency of the parent component. A change of context will cause the parent component to re-render which then re-render that "something".

One way to think about is to think about the compiled JS code.

| Case                              | JSX code                                         | JS code                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Child is inside Parent definition | `<MyComponent propA={1} />`                      | `React.createElement(MyComponent, { propA: 1 })`                |
| Child is passed as children       | `<MyComponent propA={1}><Child /></MyComponent>` | `React.createElement(MyComponent, { propA: 1, children: ... })` |

### Something that ONLY Depends on the Context Changes when Something that is not the Context Changes [^1]

If we have control over the provider, move the provider up the component tree.

If we don't have control over the provider (e.g. writing a library or reusable components), use memoization. However, simply wrapping the component with `memo()` would not work due the referential equality of the context (an object). We should memoize the whole context.

```tsx
const BookProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [book, setBook] = useState<{ name: string }>({ name: "" })

  const value = useMemo(() => {
    const changeName = (name: string) => setBook((book) => ({ ...book, name }))
    return { book, changeName }
  }, [book, setBook])

  return <BookContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</BookContext.Provider>
}
```

Note that `changeName` is also memoized, which means we don't need to `useCallback`

## React `setState` Update is not Always Necessary

An updater (e.g. `setAge(a => a + 1)`) is a callback function to derive the next state based on previous state. Some may suggest using it to update the state but it is not necessary in most cases. Most of the time it is the same as setting the state directly (i.e. `setAge(age + 1)`).

An updater is required if there are multiple updates within an event or to avoid passing the current state to a `useEffect` hook (one less dependency). [^2]

## Use a Reducer if the Next State is Calculated from Other State Variables

If the next state is calculated from the previous state, use updater to update the state. If the next state is calculated from other states, consider using a reducer. [^2]
