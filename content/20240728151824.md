- **Unit Testing**
	- Test the units of an application _individually_
	- Aim at execution speed, isolation, maintainability
	- Examples: Vitest, jest
- **Integration Testing**
	- Interactions between components. e.g. API / component test
	- Examples: WebdriverIO / Cypress
- **End-to-end Testing**
	- Test the UI from one end to the other
	- Simulate genuine user interactions
		- Cost time and computing power - higher cost
	- Examples: WebdriverIO / Cypress / Playwright / Selenium
	- **Visual UI Testing**
		- Subset of end-to-end testing
		- Take screenshots for changes for human to review
- **Static Analysis**
