# CBC Investigation of Car Thief

[The Breakdown  Hunting down Canadaâ€™s stolen cars - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=T5XJrJTG-BQ)

- Stolen cars usually shipped to Western Africa, UAE
	- Shipped to these countries because recovering it back is financially not feasible and Canada's connections to these countries is not strong enough for related parties to take actions.
- Journalists went to Ghana (West Africa) and found lots of cars with Canadian licence plates.
- Stolen cars in the video were stolen in drive way. One stolen from outdoor parking outside of owner's office.
- Should check security ratings, [[20240723150151|statistics]] before choosing a car.
	- The number is similar / higher in certain models to that in US (10x population)
