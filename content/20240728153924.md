# Line 21400 – Child Care Expenses

- caregivers providing child care services
- day nursery schools and daycare centres
- educational institutions, for the part of the fees that relate to child care services
- day camps and day sports schools where the primary goal of the camp is to care for children (an institution offering a sports study program is not a sports school)
- boarding schools, overnight sports schools, or camps where lodging is involved (read the note in Part A of [Form T778, Child Care Expenses Deduction for 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t778.html))

The above is not an exhaustive list of deductible child care expenses.
