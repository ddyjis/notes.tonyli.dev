# React

## Tips

### React `setState` Update is not Always Necessary

An updater (e.g. `setAge(a => a + 1)`) is a callback function to derive the next state based on previous state. Some may suggest using it to update the state but it is not necessary in most cases. Most of the time it is the same as setting the state directly (i.e. `setAge(age + 1)`).

An updater is required if there are multiple updates within an event or to avoid passing the current state to a `useEffect` hook (one less dependency). [^1]

### Use a Reducer if the Next State is Calculated from Other State Variables

If the next state is calculated from the previous state, use updater to update the state. If the next state is calculated from other states, consider using a reducer. [^1]

## Utilities

### Million.js

[GitHub - aidenybaimillion The Virtual DOM Replacement for React](https://github.com/aidenybai/million) replaces the Virtual DOM for React components to make it faster.

#TODO: does it work with Next.js and React 19 RSC?
