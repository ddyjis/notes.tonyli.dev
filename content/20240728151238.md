# Preparing for Coding Interview

#TODO: [How to pass a coding interview with me  Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/interview/)

This is just a copy of headings. Need to read it in details

- Before the interview
	- If you do Google the question beforehand, delete your tracks afterwards
	- Set up a basic program and make sure you can run it
- Introduction
	- Keep your personal intro short
	- Ask how much time you have to answer the question
- When you get the question
	- Restate the question, briefly
	- Ask a clarifying question or two
	- Ask how you’re being assessed
		- How far are you supposed to get?
		- Is the interviewer looking for efficient code, clean code, or both?
		- Should you write tests?
	- Sketch a solution that works for at least the base case
- Debugging
	- Run your code frequently
	- Use hypotheses to debug
	- Common trivial mistakes
	- Consider asking for help
- Talking
	- Don’t badmouth languages, libraries, or anything really
	- Talk as much as you reasonably can
- Writing the code
	- Don’t define lots of functions or classes unless you’re very certain it’s a good idea
	- Use TODOs
- Testing
	- Write tests
	- Don’t use a testing framework unless you’re required to, or you’re very confident with it
	- If a test passes, print `pass`
	- If all your tests pass first time, try to make them fail
	- Don’t do full TDD unless you actually find it helpful
	- Keep your tests
