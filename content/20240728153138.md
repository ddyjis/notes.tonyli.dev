## Physical Fitness, For Me

From a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rri4q6/how_to_be_physically_fit_as_a_software_engineer/), people suggested

- Non-screen related hobbies
	- Climbing
	- Woodworking
	- Mountain biking (Many people mentioned this, not sure why)
- Workout 3x - 4x a week
- Do 5 minutes of physical activities every hour
- Add fitness routine to waiting time (e.g. compilation / loading). "Make the time count."
