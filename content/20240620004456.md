# Less is More for Pensieve

I need Pensieve to achieve something. It is a tool, not the target. I need to _"Getting Things Done"_, not "Getting this Pensieve Done". The main goal is to get the max output with the shortest time.

$$
\text{Productivity}=\frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Effort}}
$$

Nothing is done, everything is working in progress.
