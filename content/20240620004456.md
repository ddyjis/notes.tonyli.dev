# Less is More Rule

I need all these notes to achieve something. It is a tool, not the target. I need to _"Getting Things Done"_, not "Getting this notes done". The main goal is to get the max output with the shortest time.

$$
\text{Productivity}=\frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Effort}}
$$

Nothing is done, everything is working in progress.
