# Avoid Using Obsidian Plugins

Key point: You don't need many plugins to make good notes.

This might be an unpopular opinion. One of the intention I use Obsidian is because data are owned by me - no proprietor code is added to the markdown docs. No software can last forever. There will be a time in future I need to move my notes to another service. By keeping notes in some sort of standards (Github Flavored Markdown and/or Obsidian Flavored Markdown), all data will have the flexibility to convert to another format in future.

Using plugins that augments the markdown violates this purpose and is forcing my notes to stick to Obsidian or a particular plugin. Currently (`2024-06-20`) I am using the `Linter` plugin which enforce the markdown to follow syntactic rules without additional syntax (to reduce unnecessary git changes).
