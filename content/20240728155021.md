# Case Study of Airbnb's Architecture

## First Version

- Airbnb started as a monolith using Ruby-on-Rails (a.k.a. monorail internally)
- Over time, it had become difficult to maintain
	- e.g. Ownership of data / table became unclear
	- e.g. Difficult to track code change
	- e.g. Deployment is slow

## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- Similar to microservices but each service focus on one business functionality instead of just 1 thing
- Each service handles the read / write of their own data
- Data mutation is done via standard events. And all services should behave according to the events

## Migration from a Monolith to SOC

### Version 1

- every request went through monorail
- monorail handled view, business logic and data

### Version 2

- monorail and services co-exists
	- monorail handled routing and view
	- services handled business logic and data
- 4 types of services
	- **Data Services** - all read write operations, and does not dependent on other services
	- **Derived Data Services** - read from data services and apply basic business logics
	- **Middle Tier** - Large business logic
	- **Presentation Services** - aggregate data from other services, may add frontend logic
- migration started with intercepting and rerouting request to data service and derived services. then migrate the presentation service

### Version 3

- monorail eliminated
- API gateway - route request to SOA
