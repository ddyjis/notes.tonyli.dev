# Calculating Bond Yields

A bond is a financial instrument that is priced at \$$P$, over the period of $n$ years, every year gives the bondholder \$$C$ coupon, and at maturity gives the bondholder par value at \$$V$.

For a bond with yield $y$, the price would be

$$
P = \frac{C}{(1+y)^1}+...+\frac{C}{(1+y)^n}+\frac{V}{(1+y)^n}
$$

The approximation given $y>0$ is

$$
y \approx \frac{C}{V}+\frac{\frac{V-P}{V}}{n}
$$

The first term $\frac{C}{V}$ is the nominal yield. The second term is the yield from par value for each year.

The approximation is done by assuming no discount for coupons and [[20240912132856|Taylor Series approximation]].[^1]

$$
P\approx nC+\frac{V}{(1+y)^n}
$$

With first-order Taylor series expansion for the second term at $0$,

$$
\frac{1}{(1+y)^n}=1+\frac{-n}{(1+0)^{n+1}}y=1-ny
$$

So,

$$
P\approx nC+V(1-ny) \Rightarrow y\approx \frac{P-nC-V}{-nV}=\frac{C}{V}+\frac{V-P}{nV}
$$
