# Finding the Next-Level Scope for Career Progression

Engineer promotion is based on finding scope that fits the next level's expectations. There are 2 ways to find next level opportunities. [^1]

## Receiving the Next-Level Scope

This is not a junior thing. Your senior will have problems that need to be solved.

You can ask management or tech lead. The management knows what problem the team is facing. Tech lead may have projects that they don't have time to tackle yet.

Another way is to let others come to you, by building a track record in being knowledgable in an area.

## Creating the Next-Level Scope

Usually by finding improvements on existing system. This is more and more important as you go more senior levels. 2 of the ways you can find next-level scope are as below.

When you have a strong understanding (domain expertise) about the system, ideas for improvement would come up naturally.

In features that are not fully established, you may find problems by digging around.
