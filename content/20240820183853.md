# Knowledge Formulation

Below are the rules for effective learning [^1]

1. Understand before learn
    - Understanding helps meaningful learning. Reciting without comprehension is inefficient.
    - Extreme example: you can **learn** a history textbook in German by cramming word for word. But you still **know** nothing of history. And you wasted a lot of time.
1. Learn before memorize
    - Build a picture of the knowledge to learn first. This makes all the pieces to form a coherent structure and reduce the time for memorizing.
1. Basic before complex
    - This is the extension of the previous rule. Build up the picture with basic information would be enough. Then you will have the time to go through the details when you actually work on them.
1. [[20240913102631|Minimum information principle]]
    - It is easier to learn simple stuffs because the brain will process it the same way every time. It is also easier to schedule the repetition of learning simple items.
