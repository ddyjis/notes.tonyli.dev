# Spaced Repetition Software

## Anki

- The most famous one out there. Large community
- Extensible with add-ons, including switching to other spaced repetition algorithms (e.g. FSRS)
- One time purchase for iOS app
- Poor markdown support which slows me down creating the cards

## Mochi

- Markdown support
- Syncing is behind a subscription but the price is acceptable
- More modern design which encourages me to use the app
