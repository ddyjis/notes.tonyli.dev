# Montessori Schools

- 3-year age grouping (i.e. toddler NB-3, primary 3-6, elementary 6-9, 9-12)
- Students move around with their own tasks. Pick their own tasks based on their interest and curiosity
- No pretend play but real objects (furniture, tools, utensils)
- At least 1 uninterrupted work period of 3hr. No distractions during that time
- Academics is just part of the focus. Also stress on taking care of themselves, others, environment
