# React `setState` Update is not Always Necessary

An updater (e.g. `setAge(a => a + 1)`) is a callback function to derive the next state based on previous state. Some may suggest using it to update the state but it is not necessary in most cases. Most of the time it is the same as setting the state directly (i.e. `setAge(age + 1)`).

An updater is required if there are multiple updates within an event or to avoid passing the current state to a `useEffect` hook (one less dependency)
