# The Metanotes

This is my digital notebook. I used to call it **Pensieve** because I view it as identical to the one in the Harry Potter Series - _I organize my mind by storing my thoughts and ideas in it_. It is designed with a focus on simple workflow and maximized output. Notes are connected though bi-directional links, creating a network of ideas that mirrors the complexity of human brain. But now I give it a new name, by its nature - **One Piece**.

Although these notes are public, the target audience is actually myself. This means I have the freedom to be creative and authentic to myself. This freedom also allows me to capture ideas fast which streamlines the process of note-taking.

It is hard to maintain a standard without explicitly writing it down. I have set up a few rules on my journey to One Piece.
