# Principles of Unit Testing

**Lean and accurate testing**

- Unit tests should be simple to work with
	- Design unit test for system 1 of the brain systems #TODO: write about brain systems
	- Anyone (most importantly, future self) should be able to understand the test in less than 30 seconds
- Don't pursue coverage percentage - adding useless tests is unnecessary.
- Test only the business logic and principal edge cases

**Test the behaviour, not the implementation**

- Focus on the result. The result should always the same even after refactoring.

**Test naming and structuring - AAA pattern**

- Good naming and structure help identifying the failure quickly
	- _What_ is being tested?
	- Under _what circumstances_?
	- What is the _expected outcome_?
- AAA pattern
	- Arrange - set up of the code - variables, mocked response, ...
	- Act - execute the code
	- Assert - check the result

**Deterministic and isolated tests**

- Tests should be independent and isolated. A failed test should not affect the others. This make it easier to locate the exact cause of the issue
- Each test should deal with one logic at a time

**Property-based testing and realistic data**

- In property-based testing, you describe the properties of the code, the testing library will generate randomized inputs for the tests.
